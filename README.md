# Shopping-Cart Infomration

This is just major style & edit change of the CodePen which is linked in the Credits section of the ReadME. This is a shopping cart program where you have your products listed in the Javascript file and it streams it to the HTML site and you can add/remove your products in your cart and it automatically tells you the subtotal, tax and total price. This is just the front end of the site, if you would like to continue you would have do the back end and connect the "Checkout" button.
